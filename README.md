# FugsOpusMV/MZ

Use OGG OPUS files in RPG Maker MV/MZ with looping!

RPG Maker MV and MZ both have the ability to play the newer Opus codec for OGG audio files which have better sound at a smaller size.
The problem is the engine â€‹doesn't know how to read loop tog data which is important with some BGM/BGSs.

This plugin overwrites WebAudio._readOgg to find the loop tags and sample rate.

*MV Note: Opus files won't preview in the editor but they will loop in game now!
*MZ Note: OPUS files will play in the editor but won't loop unless in game.
